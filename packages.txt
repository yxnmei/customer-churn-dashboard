### 1.4: Create `.gitignore` (if not already exists)

We already have this, but let's make sure it includes:
```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
venv/
churn/
ENV/

# Jupyter Notebook
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Data (we'll include sample data for demo)
# data/01-raw/*.csv
# data/02-preprocessed/*.csv
# data/03-features/*.csv

# Models (we NEED these for deployment!)
# models/ - COMMENTED OUT so models ARE included

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# Streamlit
.streamlit/secrets.toml
